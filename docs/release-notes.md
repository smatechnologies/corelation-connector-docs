# Corelation Connector release notes

## 22.4.3

#### -BatchQueueName leastbusy

- **INTPLT-367** The `leastbusy` Batch Queue option is now available as an option on the connector program. If the **-BatchQueueName** parameter has the value of “leastbusy”, then the connector will query the Corelation API for the set of open batch queues and enqueue the new job on the batch queue which has the least jobs enqueued. The Corelation Sub-Type configuration in Solution Manager now includes a checkbox to enable this functionality. This checkbox ensures the process runs with **-BatchQueueName** `leastbusy`.

## 22.4.0

#### SMARunCorelationJob

- **CONNUTIL-631**: Bug fix to parse KeyStone xml response using Unix as well as Windows style life feed characters 

## 22.3.0

#### SMARunCorelationJob

- **CONNUTIL-609**: Existing implementation of Corelation connector required the user to configure the exact encryption level (SSL3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS1.1 or TLS1.2) being used by the server in the ini file used in the job. That is difficult to know for the implementation user and made it difficult to get the corelation job working without trying the possible combinations. Changed connector logic to use secure protocol level offered by server if not specifically configured (SSL3.0, TLS1.0-1.2) in the connector ini. Now the user can just leave the TLSVersion=N/A in the ini file (which is default) and it will automatically connect using the encryption level offered by server.

In case of SSL errors, the error message didn’t describe in detail if there was a problem with the certificate expiry date or hostname or revocation or something else that caused the connection to fail. Added more detailed logging for connection error information to help users figure out what the problem might be.

## 22.2.0

#### SMARunCorelationJob

- **CONNUTIL-583**: Added config entry to specify TLS version number (TLS12,TLS11, TLS, or N/A).
