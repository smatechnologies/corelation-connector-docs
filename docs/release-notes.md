# Corelation Connector release notes

## 22.3.0

#### SMARunCorelationJob

- **CONNUTIL-609**: Existing implementation of Corelation connector required the user to configure the exact encryption level (SSL3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS1.1 or TLS1.2) being used by the server in the ini file used in the job. That is difficult to know for the implementation user and made it difficult to get the corelation job working without trying the possible combinations. Changed connector logic to use secure protocol level offered by server if not specifically configured (SSL3.0, TLS1.0-1.2) in the connector ini. Now the user can just leave the TLSVersion=N/A in the ini file (which is default) and it will automatically connect using the encryption level offered by server.

In case of SSL errors, the error message didnâ€™t describe in detail if there was a problem with the certificate expiry date or hostname or revocation or something else that caused the connection to fail. Added more detailed logging for connection error information to help users figure out what the problem might be.
